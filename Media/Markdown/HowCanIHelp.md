## How can I help?
You could join to help finding meanings for various SRAM offsets.
This can be done either by using 

* [Web Comparison](http://compare.xeth.de){target="_blank"}
* Release

Once you found a meaning for a offset value, try to enable or disable this flag in other SRAM (*.srm) files to prove your discovery. 
Reading and manipulating offset values can be done either by using  

* [Web Offset Editor](http://offset.xeth.de){target="_blank"}
