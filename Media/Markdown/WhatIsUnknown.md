## What's still unknown?
A little less than 50% of SoE's SRAM file game slot format is still considered as 'unknown', meaning that we don't really know what these parts of SRAM actually do.
Most of unknown parts are reserved for pick-up information of various ingredient sniff spots, opened chests, gourds, pots and which persons were spoken to twice. Despite these there are also game relevant progress flags which we want to know to write more capable SRAM editors.
